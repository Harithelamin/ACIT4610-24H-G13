\section{Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)}
The VRPTW was a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which was crucial in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management. In VRPTW, a fleet of vehicles had to deliver goods to multiple customers. Each customer had a specific time window during which the delivery had to occur. The challenge was to design routes that minimized the total travel distance while ensuring all deliveries met their respective time constraints. This task focused on optimizing the delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles using two nature-inspired optimization algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). 
\newline
We defined the objective as finding the most efficient routes for a set of vehicles, ensuring that all customers receive their deliveries within specified time windows.
\newline
We implemented both Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. We then compared the effectiveness of these algorithms. 
\newline
The primary objective of the VRPTW is to minimize the total distance travelled by all vehicles 
while ensuring that: 
\newline
\newline 1. Each customer is visited exactly once by one vehicle. 
\newline 2. Deliveries occur within the specified time windows. 
\newline 3. The total demand on any route does not exceed the vehicle's capacity. 
\subsection{Data Exploration, and pre processing}
We used Solomonâ€™s VRPTW Benchmark Problems dataset, C101.txt [5].
\newline
The columns in the dataset are:
\newline
CUST NO.: Customer number (ID).
\newline
XCOORD: X coordinate of the customer's location.
\newline
YCOORD: Y coordinate of the customer's location.
\newline
DEMAND: The demand at the customer location.
\newline
READY TIME: The earliest time at which service can begin.
\newline
DUE DATE: The latest time by which the service should be completed.
\newline
SERVICE TIME: The time it takes to complete the service for this customer.
\subsection{Define the VRPTW}
From information above, and given dataset, we can define the VRPTW as follows[15]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( K \) be the number of vehicles.
    \item Let \( N \) be the number of customers.
    \item The objective is to minimize the total travel distance.
\end{itemize}

The variables involved are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{ijk} \): A binary variable indicating if vehicle \( k \) travels directly from customer \( i \) to customer \( j \).
    \item \( t_i \): The arrival time of vehicle \( k \) at customer \( i \).
    \item \( q_i \): The demand of customer \( i \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time Windows}
To calculate the time window, we need the Time Window formula for our problem. For each customer \( i \), the time window is defined as:
\[
\text{Time Window}_i = [\text{READY TIME}_i, \text{DUE DATE}_i]
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{READY TIME}_i \) is the earliest time at which the service can start for customer \( i \).
    \item \( \text{DUE DATE}_i \) is the latest time by which the service must be completed for customer \( i \).
\end{itemize}

The vehicle must arrive at customer \( i \) within the specified time window.

    \label{fig:Customer Time Windows}
\end{figure}

\subsection{City Coordinate}
In order to calculate city Coordinate, we need to define city Coordinates Formula[17]. 
\newline
City Coordinates Formula:
\newline
For each customer \(i\), the city coordinates are defined as:

\[
\text{City Coordinates}_i = (X_i, Y_i)
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( X_i \) is the \(x\)-coordinate (longitude or horizontal distance) of the customer's location.
    \item \( Y_i \) is the \(y\)-coordinate (latitude or vertical distance) of the customer's location.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/Citye_Routes_And_Time_Windows.PNG}
    \caption{City Routes And Time Windows}
    \label{fig:City Routes And Time Windows}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Dist Matrix}
To calculate the distance between two customers \(i\) and \(j\) based on their coordinates, we use the Euclidean distance formula[17]:
\newline Distance Formula:
\newline
\[
d_{ij} = \sqrt{(X_j - X_i)^2 + (Y_j - Y_i)^2}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( d_{ij} \) is the Euclidean distance between customer \(i\) and customer \(j\).
    \item \( X_i, Y_i \) are the coordinates of customer \(i\).
    \item \( X_j, Y_j \) are the coordinates of customer \(j\).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Penalty Calculation}
To handle early or late arrivals, we need to define a function to calculate the penalty for early or late arrivals as follows:
\newline
\newline 1. Penalty Mechanism: If a vehicle arrives too early.
\newline 2. Handling Early Arrival: If a vehicle arrives before the allowed time window.
\newline 3. Handling Late Arrival: If a vehicle arrives after the time window.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{The Penalty Approach}:
If the ant arrives before the city's start time, the ant has to wait. while in case of late arrival: If the ant arrives after the city's end time, a penalty is applied. We will add a penalty based on how late the ant is.
\newline
In order to calculate the penalty, we need to define the penalty calculation formula.
\newline
Penalty Calculation:
For each customer \(i\), the penalty is calculated based on their arrival time \(t_i\) and the time window \([e_i, l_i]\):

\[
\text{Penalty}_i =
\begin{cases}
\text{penalty\_factor} \times (e_i - t_i) & \text{if } t_i < e_i \\
\text{penalty\_factor} \times (t_i - l_i) & \text{if } t_i > l_i \\
0 & \text{otherwise, if } e_i \leq t_i \leq l_i
\end{cases}
\]

The total penalty is the sum of the individual penalties for each customer:

\[
\text{Total Penalty} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Penalty}_i
\]
\subsection{Decision Variable}
\textbf{Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Hyperparameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vehicle Capacity: \( \text{vehicle\_capacity} = 10 \)
    \item Number of Ants: \( \text{num\_ants} = 20 \)
    \item Number of Iterations: \( \text{num\_iterations} = 100 \)
    \item Influence of Pheromone: \( \alpha = 1.0 \)
    \item Influence of Distance: \( \beta = 2.0 \)
    \item Pheromone Evaporation Rate: \( \rho = 0.1 \)
    \item Total Pheromone Deposited by Each Ant: \( Q = 100 \)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Hyperparameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of Particles: \( \text{num\_particles} = 20 \)
    \item Number of Iterations: \( \text{num\_iterations} = 100 \)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Implement Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for VRPTW:}
We implemented an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with time windows.
The implementation has been completed in a few steps[18]:
\newline 1. Initialization: Pheromones are initialized on all values as defined above.
\newline 2. Solution Construction: Each ant constructs a solution based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
\newline 3. Fitness Evaluation: Each solution is evaluated, and a fitness value (cost or travel time) is computed.
\newline 4. Pheromone Update: is the key feature of ACO. Pheromone update formula defined as follows:
\newline
\begin{equation}
\tau_{ij}(t+1) = (1 - \rho) \cdot \tau_{ij}(t) + \Delta \tau_{ij}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\tau_{ij}(t)\) is the pheromone level on edge \(ij\) at time \(t\),
    \item \(\rho\) is the evaporation rate,
    \item \(\Delta \tau_{ij}\) is the pheromone deposited by ants after each iteration.
\end{itemize}

The pheromone update rule consists of two main parts.
\newline 5. Iteration: The process repeats for several iterations, improving the solutions over time.
\subsection{Implement Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for VRPTW:}
We implemented Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with time windows.
The implementation has been completed in a few steps[18]:
\newline 1. Initialize a population of particles, each with a random position and velocity in the search space. 
\newline 2. Fitness Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each particle using a fitness function, which determines the quality of the solution.
\newline 3. Update Personal Best: If the current position of a particle is better than its previous best position, update it with the current position.
\newline 4. Velocity Update: Update the velocity of each particle using the formula[19]:
\newline
\begin{equation}
v_i^{t+1} = w \cdot v_i^t + c_1 \cdot r_1 \cdot (pbest_i - x_i^t) + c_2 \cdot r_2 \cdot (gbest - x_i^t)
\end{equation}
Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( v_i^{t+1} \): The updated velocity of particle \(i\) at time \(t+1\).
    \item \( v_i^t \): The current velocity of particle \(i\) at time \(t\).
    \item \( x_i^t \): The current position of particle \(i\) at time \(t\).
    \item \( pbest_i \): The personal best position of particle \(i\) (i.e., the best position found by particle \(i\) so far).
    \item \( gbest \): The global best position found by any particle in the swarm.
    \item \( c_1, c_2 \): The acceleration constants (also known as the \textit{cognitive} and \textit{social} coefficients), which control the influence of the particle's own best experience and the swarm's global experience, respectively.
    \item \( r_1, r_2 \): Random numbers between 0 and 1 that introduce stochasticity into the update, helping to explore the solution space more thoroughly.
    \item \( w \): The \textit{inertia weight}, which controls the balance between \textit{exploration} (searching new areas) and \textit{exploitation} (refining the best-known solutions). A higher \(w\) favors exploration, while a lower \(w\) favors exploitation.
\end{itemize}
5. Position Update: Update the position of each particle using the formula:
\newline
\begin{equation}
x_i^{t+1} = x_i^t + v_i^{t+1}
\end{equation}
6. Termination: Repeat steps 2 to 6 until a stopping condition is met.

\end{figure}
As seen in the previous statistics, the running time for ACO optimization was 0.0160 seconds, while the running time for PSO optimization was 0.0209 seconds. This indicates that ACO is faster than PSO. 
\newline
In adithon, the best distance achieved by ACO is 65,254.61, while the best distance achieved by PSO is 525.22. This indicates that the ACO algorithm has a higher value for the distance metric.

Moreover, The best solution (path) obtained by the ACO algorithm is:
[21, 16, 22, 14, 24, 17, 1, 13, 11, 0, 18, 6, 19, 23, 4, 20, 10, 15, 5, 12, 7, 9, 8, 2, 3].

On the other hand, the best solution (path) obtained by the PSO algorithm is:
[17, 0, 16, 20, 15, 3, 12, 2, 19, 22, 1, 24, 9, 18, 8, 13, 4, 7, 11, 21, 23, 5, 10, 6, 14].

Overall, both ACO and PSO provide valid solutions, but they may represent different trade-offs in optimization based on their respective mechanisms.
