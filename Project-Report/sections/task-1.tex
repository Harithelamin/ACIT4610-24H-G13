Will focus on optimizing traffic management for the three to five road segments in New 
York City. For example: 
1. 5th Ave between 42nd St and 47th St (Manhattan) 
2. Atlantic Ave between Flatbush Ave and Bedford Ave (Brooklyn) 
3. Queens Blvd between Union Tpke and Yellowstone Blvd (Queens) 
4. Grand Concourse between E 161st St and E 170th St (Bronx) 
5. Victory Blvd between Richmond Ave and Clove Rd (Staten Island) 
The traffic management strategy involves controlling traffic signal timings (green, yellow, and 
red light durations) and setting speed limits on these segments. Your task is to develop an 
MOEA (discussed in lectures) that optimizes these parameters to achieve the best trade-off 
between minimizing TTT and FC.
